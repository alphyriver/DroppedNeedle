"""Pluggable download-client contract (the *acquire → track → locate* half of
the split, D2).

Stable boundary between ``services/native`` and any concrete download client.
The orchestrator, matcher, and file processor import only this module's
protocol types, never ``repositories/slskd``. Search now lives on
``IndexerProtocol`` (``indexer.py``); this module no longer carries
``search_*``.

Does NOT use ``from __future__ import annotations``: the conformance contract
test compares ``inspect.signature`` of the protocol methods against each
implementation, so annotations here and in every implementation must be real
objects (not strings) and identical.
